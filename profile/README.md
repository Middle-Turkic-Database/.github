A Database of Middle Turkic (https://middleturkic.lingfil.uu.se/)

Middle Turkic is a cover term for various literary languages used by the Turkic-speaking peoples of Eurasia from the 13th century up to the early modern times. The entire territory ranges from Central Asia to Egypt, from Lituania and the Volga region to Iran and Anatolia. The era may symbolically begin with the coming of the Mongols and the growing influence of Persian and Arabic. The end of Middle Turkic varies from region to region. 1 November 1928 is a symbolic endpoint in Anatolia considering the introduction of the Latin-based Turkish alphabet. In territories occupied or controlled by the Russians, the October revolution of 25 October 1917 puts an end to Middle Turkic.

Middle Turkic includes the following literary languages:

    Khwarezmian Turkic
    Chagatai
    Armeno-Kipchak
    Middle Karaim
    Mamluk Turkic
    Volga Turkic
    Cuman
    Volga Bulgar
    Ottoman

The aim of the database is to provide a comprehensive edition of Middle Turkic sources in digital form. The corpus including transcription and translation of manuscript sources uses a unified description model. The texts are encoded in EpiDoc-XML and available under the terms and conditions of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license.

Due to the size of Middle Turkic including several literary languages and thousands of manuscript sources from a vast territory, the corpus establishment started with the addition of Middle Karaim source as an immediate contribution of the KaraimBIBLE research project to the database. At later stages, sources from other Middle Turkic literary languages will be added to the database.
