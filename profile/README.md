[Website of the database](https://middleturkic.lingfil.uu.se)

Middle Turkic is a cover term for various literary languages used by the Turkic-speaking peoples of Eurasia from the 13th century up to the early modern times. The entire territory ranges from Central Asia to Egypt, from Lituania and the Volga region to Iran and Anatolia. The era may symbolically begin with the coming of the Mongols and the growing influence of Persian and Arabic. The end of Middle Turkic varies from region to region. 1 November 1928 is a symbolic endpoint in Anatolia considering the introduction of the Latin-based Turkish alphabet. In territories occupied or controlled by the Russians, the October revolution of 25 October 1917 puts an end to Middle Turkic.

Middle Turkic includes the following literary languages:

* Khwarezmian Turkic
* Chagatai
* Armeno-Kipchak
* Middle Karaim
* Mamluk Turkic
* Volga Turkic
* Cuman
* Volga Bulgar
* Ottoman
* Middle Azeri
* Middle Turkmen

The aim of the database is to provide a comprehensive edition of Middle Turkic sources in digital form. The corpus including transcription and translation of manuscript sources uses a unified description model. The texts are encoded in [EpiDoc-XML](https://github.com/EpiDoc) and available under the terms and conditions of the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) license.

Due to the size of Middle Turkic including several literary languages and thousands of manuscript sources from a vast territory, the corpus establishment started with the addition of [Middle Karaim](https://middleturkic.lingfil.uu.se/manuscripts/middle-karaim) source as an immediate contribution of the [KaraimBIBLE](https://karaimbible.filg.uj.edu.pl) research project to the database. Sources from other Middle Turkic literary languages will gradually be added to the database.
